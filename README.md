# ContactExtractor
**ContactExtractor** is a simple yet powerful Python script that automatically extracts **phone numbers** and **email addresses** from any copied text (from your clipboard).  
It uses the `re` (Regular Expressions) module for pattern matching and `pyperclip` for clipboard access.

This tool is inspired by practical text processing problems — for example, scanning a web page, document, or message for contact information — and can easily be adapted for automation scripts or data cleaning workflows.
